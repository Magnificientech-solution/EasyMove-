// 3. Haversine calculation with UK-specific road winding factors
export async function calculateDistance(from: string, to: string): Promise<{
  distance: number;
  unit: string;
  estimatedTime: number;
  exactCalculation: boolean;
}> {
  // Try city pairs first for accurate distances
  const fromCities = extractCityNames(from);
  const toCities = extractCityNames(to);
  
  // Check city pair database
  for (const fromCity of fromCities) {
    if (UK_CITY_DISTANCES[fromCity]) {
      for (const toCity of toCities) {
        const distance = UK_CITY_DISTANCES[fromCity][toCity];
        if (distance) {
          return {
            distance,
            unit: "miles",
            estimatedTime: estimateTime(distance, from, to),
            exactCalculation: true
          };
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Fall back to Haversine with UK adjustments
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Smart Price Calculation

The pricing calculation now includes:
