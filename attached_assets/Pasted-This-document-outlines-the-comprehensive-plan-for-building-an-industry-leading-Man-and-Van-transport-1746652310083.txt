UK postcode approximation for more accurate distance estimates
Price Calculation Consistency

Issue: Price inconsistencies between quote generation and checkout
Solution:
Standardized rounding functions across all price calculations
Consistent VAT calculation and formatting
Proper handling of price breakdown elements
Quote Storage and Retrieval

Issue: Inconsistent quote data storage leading to calculation discrepancies
Solution:
Enhanced quote context with better persistence
Properly typed quote data structure
Improved validation of stored quote data
Payment Processing Issues

Improved error handling and user feedback
PayPal Integration

Issue: Outdated PayPal integration causing payment failures
Solution:
Implemented PayPal's latest SDK client integration
Enhanced server-side PayPal order processing
Improved order capture and validation
Payment Confirmation Flow

Issue: Unreliable payment confirmation and booking creation
Solution:
Streamlined success/failure handling for payment providers
Centralized booking creation process

Quote Generation Feature Enhancements
1. Advanced Distance Calculation
The enhanced distance calculator includes:

// Multiple distance calculation strategies with fallbacks:
// 1. Exact distance lookup for common city pairs
// 2. UK postcode-based calculation with regional adjustments
// 3. Haversine calculation with UK-specific road winding factors
export async function calculateDistance(from: string, to: string): Promise<{
  distance: number;
  unit: string;
  estimatedTime: number;
  exactCalculation: boolean;
}> {
  // Try city pairs first for accurate distances
  const fromCities = extractCityNames(from);
  const toCities = extractCityNames(to);
  
  // Check city pair database
  for (const fromCity of fromCities) {
    if (UK_CITY_DISTANCES[fromCity]) {
      for (const toCity of toCities) {
        const distance = UK_CITY_DISTANCES[fromCity][toCity];
        if (distance) {
          return {
            distance,
            unit: "miles",
            estimatedTime: estimateTime(distance, from, to),
            exactCalculation: true
          };
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Fall back to Haversine with UK adjustments
  // ...
}
2. Smart Price Calculation
The pricing calculation now includes:

Base fare calculation based on distance and vehicle size
Labor costs based on number of helpers and estimated time
Floor access and stairs premiums
Peak time and weekend surcharges
Urgency surcharges (standard, express, priority)
Fuel cost calculation with distance and vehicle MPG
Return journey discounting
Proper VAT calculation and rounding
Platform fee calculation (25% platform fee, 75% to drivers)
3. Improved Time Estimation
Travel time estimates now factor in:

Road types (motorways, urban, rural)
Time of day considerations
Traffic patterns for major cities (especially London)
Loading/unloading time
Floor access and stairs
Payment Processing Improvements
1. Stripe Checkout Session Implementation
For a more reliable payment flow:

// Create checkout session with better formatting and details
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: 'gbp',
        product_data: {
          name: 'EasyMove Man and Van Service',
          description: `${description} - ${formattedDate}`,
        },
        unit_amount: amountInPennies,
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: 'payment',
  customer_email: customerEmail || null,
  metadata: {
    pickupAddress: pickupAddress || '',
    deliveryAddress: deliveryAddress || '',
    vanSize: vanSize || '',
    moveDate: moveDateString || '',
    amount: amount.toString()
  },
  success_url: `${origin}/booking-confirmation?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${origin}/stripe-checkout`,
});
2. PayPal Integration Enhancement
Enhanced PayPal integration with:

Latest PayPal SDK with modern web components
Server-side order creation with proper validation
Comprehensive error handling
Order capturing with transaction verification
3. Security Improvements
Proper API key management and validation
Server-side validation for all payment requests
Secure metadata handling for booking details
Consistent error handling with user-friendly messages
Implementation Steps

Testing & Verification
Quote Calculation Tests
Run the testQuoteCalculation() function to verify calculation accuracy:

// Test cases with known distances and expected price ranges
const testCases = [
  {
    params: {
      distanceMiles: 10,
      vanSize: 'medium',
      estimatedHours: 2,
      // ... other parameters ...
    },
    expectedRange: {
      totalPrice: { min: 80, max: 120 },
      totalWithVAT: { min: 95, max: 145 }
    }
  },
  // ... more test cases ...
];
Payment Integration Tests
Stripe Test Mode:

Use Stripe test cards to verify successful payments
Test declined payments and proper error handling
Verify webhook processing for payment events

Deployment Recommendations
Environment Configuration:

Ensure all payment API keys are properly set in environment variables
Configure proper error reporting and monitoring
Set up domain and SSL certificates for secure payments
Database Considerations:

Ensure database schema supports all quote and booking fields
Implement proper indexing for address and booking queries
Set up regular backups for booking and payment data
Scaling Considerations:

Implement caching for common city pair distances
Consider rate limiting for quote calculation API
Set up load balancing for high-traffic periods
Conclusion
By implementing these improvements, the EasyMove Man and Van application will provide accurate, transparent quotes and secure, reliable payment processing. The focus on distance calculation accuracy, consistent pricing, and streamlined payment flows will position the platform competitively against established players in the market.

The modular approach allows for incremental improvements and ensures that each component can be tested and verified independently. The separation of concerns between distance calculation, price calculation, and payment processing makes the system more maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
